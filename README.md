Hey there stranger 👋👋🏻

This repository is a collection of Advent of Code 2023, solution in SWI-Prolog. I am learning prolog as I go, so the quality of the code might be terrible, and hard to read, I am still not sure of formatting and naming guidelines, but hey, it might improve time, we shall see 👀👀👀
